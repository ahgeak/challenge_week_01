## Description

Horiseon Social Solution Services is a marketing agency with a codebase they would like to be refractored. This codebase now follows accessibility standards to allow for users to easily use the website. The site has been optimised for search engines.

While working on this project I learned semantic HTML, website architecture and structure, class and id attributes, and basic CSS formating.

## Usage

Deployed webpage: https://ahgeak.github.io/urban-octo-telegram_wk01/

Users can naviate throughout the page using the three navigation links at the top of the page. The 
Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and the Social Media Marketing links will lead the user to the appropriate sections of the website.

## Credits

The original codebase for this project were provided by the client and the client is the author of the original index.html file and style.css file.

Anna C (myself) refractored the codebase to make the site more accessible and to create a more clear code structure.
